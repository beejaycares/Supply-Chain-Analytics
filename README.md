# Supply-Chain-Analytics

Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, and OnTime in full (OTIF) %’ of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

Task:  

As a data analyst who is excited to build this dashboard and perform the following task:

1.	Create the metrics according to the metrics list.

2.	Create a dashboard according to the requirements provided by stakeholders in the business review meeting. You will be provided with the transcript of this business review meeting in comic form.

3.	Create relevant insights not provided in the metric list/stakeholder meeting.



# Project Title: Supply Chain Analytics 



# Project Short Info: 

Built a Power BI dashboard to monitor On-Time, In-Full, and On-Time In-Full (OTIF) delivery performance across customer orders, enabling rapid identification of service gaps and data-informed decisions.


# Project Description:

Developed an end-to-end interactive dashboard using Power BI to monitor delivery performance for AtliQ Mart, a fast-growing FMCG company. The dashboard tracked three core service metrics - On-Time Delivery %, In-Full Delivery %, and OTIF % - mapped against customer-specific targets. Leveraging historical order data, I created dynamic visualisations that allowed the supply chain team to monitor customer performance daily, identify recurring delivery failures, and prioritise issue resolution. Additional insights, such as trend anomalies and underperforming products, were generated beyond the stakeholder-defined scope. The dashboard included slicers by city, product, customer, and date for operational agility and strategic planning.


What I Learned:

•	How to translate stakeholder business questions into measurable KPIs

•	Hands-on experience designing OT, IF, and OTIF-related DAX measures and time-series visuals

•	Advanced use of slicers, tooltips, and conditional formatting in Power BI

•	Enhanced my knowledge on data modelling

•	Gained insight into FMCG logistics and performance monitoring

•	Strengthened ability to deliver business value through visual analytics
